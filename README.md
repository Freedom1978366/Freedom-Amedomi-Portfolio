## About

I am a graduate of the University of Ghana with a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics. During my study, I developed a strong analytical foundation through courses like Regression Analysis, Probability, and Functional Analysis. These strengthened my ability to interpret data trends, manage uncertainty, and apply statistical thinking to real-world challenges skills that are essential in data analytics. 

I also have two and half years of experience in the insurance industry, where I worked as a Premium Administrator and Claims Officer. In these roles, I was responsible for cleaning and validating customer data for bank billing, vetting policy cases for approval, and processing claims due to clients - an experience that sharpened my attention to detail, accuracy, and data handling skills.
